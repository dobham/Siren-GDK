A simple, easy to use, game development kit intended to easily create or randomly generate entire 3D games similar to Wolfenstine 3D. Utilizes a homemade 3D raycaster for players to view the world through. In later iterations, the ablity to import textures will also be added for further customization of games alongside having the randomly generated ones be more interesting to look at!
